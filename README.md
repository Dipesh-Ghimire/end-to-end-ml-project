# End-to-End ML Project for RETAIL SALES PREDICTION
![alt text](static/ss.png)
- This project is an End-to-End ML solution integrated with a Flask Web App to provide real-time predictions of ITEM OUTLET SALES for RETAIL BUSINESSES.
- The prediction is based on various input features, including item attributes (such as weight, visibility, and MRP), and outlet characteristics (such as outlet type, size, location, and year of establishment).
- It features a modular code structure that automates the entire Training Pipeline, including data ingestion, data transformation, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation.
- The Prediction Pipeline is optimized for seamless user interaction through the web app. 
- Additionally, GitHub Actions are used to automate the deployment process to Azure Web Apps, enabling efficient and scalable production-level deployment without manual intervention. 
- This setup ensures an effective, robust solution for real-time ML applications.
